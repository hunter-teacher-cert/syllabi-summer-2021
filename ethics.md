## Course Description:
*"Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should." - Jurassic Park, Michael Crichton*

Ethical concerns are frequently ignored in technical fields, but as a society we are discovering their immense importance. Algorithms can have unintended affects due to hidden bias, security and privacy can be affected negatively when decisions are made for technical merit or user convenience. Social networks have resulted in issues ranging from fake news to echo chambers and more. In this course we will explore ethical issues in computer science through a combination of programming assignments, case studies and discussions of current events.

### Expected Learning Outcomes:

#### By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Create programs and computer-based systems that minimize negative ethical factors such as bias and unintended consequences.

2. Create programs and computer-based systems that maximize factors including accessiblity, equity, and diversity.

3. Analyze existing computer systems to determine where factors such as bias, unintended consequences and other ethical concerns exist.

4. Understand how human factors can influence otherwise deterministic technical processes.

### Required Text: 

There is no required text for this course. Readings will be assigned from a variety of sources, as outlined in the syllabus.

## Evaluation:

- Final project/paper: 30%
- Programming assignments: 30%
- Presentations / accompanying papers: 20%
