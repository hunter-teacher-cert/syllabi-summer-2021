# Methods for teaching computer science

# Course Description

Familiarizes teachers, grades with pedagogical approaches and
innovative teaching techniques needed to convey to a diverse
population emerging state and professional standards-based curriculum
in computer science. Innovative uses of technology, development of
instructional units, individualizing for a diverse population of
students, and strategies for managing problem behavior will be
emphasized throughout the course.

## Schedule
	- July 9 - July 30, Monday - Friday 12:30 - 3:00


## Grading

 - 40% : Demonstration of an understanding of CS teaching methods through class discussion, breakout rooms, small presentations.
 - 40% : Use of effective methods in delivery of Topics project
 - 20% : participation


## By the end of this course, students will be able to:
   - develop coherent, meaningful goals, plans and materials.
   - Plan and deliver effective computer science instruction.
   - assess learning and differentiate instruction for diverse populations.
   - Employ a variety of effective pedagogical standards in order to deliver instruction aligned with the proposed CSTA standards.
   - Use current technology and CS content and wil be able to learn new technologies and content. Teacher-candidates will be able to develop coherent, meaningful goals, plans, and materials.
