# SEDC 72900 - Methods 2


# Course Description

This course will prepare teacher-candidates to use a variety of
pedagogical techniques including both general and those specific to
teaching computer science.  Teacher-candidates will also become
knowledgable in social and ethical issues related to computer science
and computing including privacy, cyber bullying, and
piracy. Teacher-candidates will learn to use a variety of technical
tools to both administer their class as well as to support instruction
and learning.  Within each of the specific topics, attention will be
paid to working with diverse populations as well as aligning lessons
to the proposed CSTA standards. Additionally, topics such as classroom
management techniques, questioning, and using assessments to drive
instruction will be woven throughout all of the units.

## Grading

 - 40% : Demonstration of an understanding of CS teaching methods through class discussion, breakout rooms, small presentations.
 - 40% : Use of effective methods in delivery of Topics project
 - 20% : participation
