# CSCI 70900 - Programming in a high level language

### Department Of Computer Science
### Hunter College, CUNY
### Summer Semester 2021
### Professor William Sakas
### Office Hours: TBA And By Appointment



# Course Description

Programming in a high level language introduces students to computer
programming and goes well beyond an introductory class. The course
will provide an overview of a language such as Java language and dive
into important programming concepts including object-oriented
programming, inheritance, exception handling, debugging techniques and
more.

	
## Schedule
	- June 28 - July 8, Monday - Friday 9:00 - 3:00 

## Grading

 - 80% : Projects/programming assignments (listed by topic)
 - 20% : Participation


## By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Understand the basics of object oriented computer programming
   including classes, methods, variables, data flow, data types and
   data structures.
2. Write programs of moderate complexity
3. Acquire data from outside sources and use programming techniques to
   analyze data and visualize results.
5. Use techniques from the field of computer science and apply them to
   problems in other fields.
