# CSCI 70700 - Modern Topics in Computer Science

# Course Description

This course will provide students with base knowledge in a number of
the most important disciplines in computer science. Students will
study and create working systems using a variety of tools, techniques,
and technologies.  Sample topics include functional programming, data
mining, computer graphics, and artificial intelligence.

## Grading

 - 80% : Projects/programming assignments
 - 20% : Participation

The topics class will require each student to work in a team to
research and deliver a project on a topic in computer science that
they select. The project will include both a GitHub repo consisting of
the documentation and source code and a class presentation.
	
The project must:

	1. Exhibit that the participants have a knowledge and understanding of the topic.  
    2. Include code illustrating at least proof of concept on the selected topic.
	
	3. Include an in class exercise or activity for the class to allow all students to explore the selected topic.
	
	4. Include a short homework assignment for the class to allow all students to explore the selected topic.
	


## By the end of this course, students will be able to:
  - learn the fundamentals of each subfield studied in this course.
  - use online and community resources to further their own professional development and study of computer science.
